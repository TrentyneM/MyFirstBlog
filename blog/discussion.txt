The Disc Golf Leauge project is coming together with a wireframe
and so far I have the basic framework down for a Django site despite
having a lot of work to do still. 

I had a lot of problems getting a website to initially work so I started
a new bare bones template for the website and I've been using forms to keep
track of user data. Right now I am having a challenge trying to implement
login forms and am possibly thinking about scaling back features to prevent
issues and be on time. 

Hello! Your management system sounds very professional and well-planned! I'm
excited to see what your web app's interface will look like!

Your inventory management system is doing very well! Your application is very
feature rich and can be deployed for multiple purposes, would love to see it
when it's finished!
